Installation
--------------------------------------------
### Ubuntu Linux Installation

This vim configuration includes a lot of great plugins, configurations and color schemes that
make VIM a lot better. To install it simply do following:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/dyxu/vimrc.git

You'd better backup your vim configuration.

    mv .vim .vim.bak
    mv .vimrc .vimrc.bak

Then

    cp ./vim/.vim ./
    cp ./vim/.vimrc .vimrc

The vimrc is already setup, have fun!

### Errors In Installation

#### ctags or cscope

ctags and cscope should be installed for some plugins (SrcExpl and ccvext). so install them:

    sudo apt-get install ctags
    sudo apt-get install cscope

#### YouCompleteMe

you need reinstall YouCompleteMe for your local environment sometimes.(more details in [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe))
